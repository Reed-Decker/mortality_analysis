#Mortality Analysis
For this analysis, we'll be looking at how causes of death have changed over the years based on age, gender, and ethnicity. All data is taken from the [CDC compressed mortality dataset for years 1999-2016](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/cdc-wonder-mortality-underlying-cause-of-death). 

##

Due to limitations on how many results the CDC Wonder page is able to give, I had to submit seperate queries for each ethnicity category. As such, my first step is to merge this back together into a single dataset.

```{r load_merge}

```
